    <p class = "para"> In the month of August 1962, J.C.R. Licklider of MIT thought of a network protocol to send a series of memos. <br> Envisioning a globally interconnected world, he dubbed this concept “Galactic Network”. Later that year, he became the first head of the DARPA project “ARPANET” which kicked off information-sharing technology between geographically separated computers. <br></br>However, there was one big problem with ARPANET’s framework: maintaining all communications on a single node. The need for a decentralized ARPANET was clear. Packet switching was the answer to this issue; rather than having one central node, packets which are essentially fragments of data, would be sent to multiple nodes so that if one packet was found faulty, it could be sent back to get fixed and then resent to finish the communication. The first four nodes of the ARPANET were:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>	University of California, Santa Barbara </li>
        <li>	University of California, Los Angeles </li>
        <li>	University of Utah </li>
        <li>	Stanford Research Institute </li>
        </ol>

        Bob Kahn was a key player in the formulation of packet switching. He was the first to model TCP protocol as we know it today, which enabled open-architecture networking. He was the first to introduce a computer whose sole purpose was to forward packets from end-users, AKA routers. A few key points to Kahn’s protocol are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>	If a packet encountered an issue along the way, it would alert the sender, and retransmit shortly after</li>
        <li>	No data would be retained by routers. They would simply forward packets from the source to the destination to avoid additional complexities </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "para">With packet switching in place, the first email was sent in October of 1972. Ray Tomlinson wrote the first basic email software enabling users to send and read messages. After this monumental achievement in the scaling of the internet, things started moving very quickly.
