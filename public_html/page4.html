                <p style = "color: white;">Developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, HTTP is an application layer protocol that makes communication between servers on the World Wide Web possible. An overview of the function of HTTP is as follows: when a user accesses a web browser (client), a request called a HTTP GET request is made to the web-server to fetch the content requested by the client. The server then sends back files such as HTML and CSS to the browser so that the user can then interact with the webpage. If a request is faulty, error codes such as 404 are sent back to the user as a placeholder until the error is resolved. <br> <br> While HTTP operates on a very high level today, consecutively managing several requests and balancing traffic from several clients, it started as a one-line protocol. HTTP 0.9 was the first version of HTTP which had the main goals of file transfer functionality, ability to index search and request transfer between different servers. This protocol  supported a single GET method which included the path of the requested file and the response wa also a single document without any metadata or headers. <br> <br> From 1991-1995, the emergence of the web browser, spearheaded by Marc Andreessen, brought the need for an upgraded HTTP. There was now a need for a protocol to support more than just hypertext documents. Thus, HTTP 1.0 was born. Now, the HTTP request could support multiple lines, including information about the status of the response to improve reliability. The request could also handle headers and now the connection between client and server was severed with each request.<br> <br> HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2 were the next improvements in this protocol and focused on performance. Amongst the capabilities of HTTP 1.1 were:</p>

                    <li>Caching Direction</li>
                    <li>Client Cookies</li>
                    <li>Transfer Encoding</li>
                    <li>Language Negotiation</li>
                </ul>
                <p style = "color: white;">HTTP 2 took on network performance improvements by enabling lower latency and higher throughput. It is designed to handle any input from an application and deliver the user with virtually 0ms wait time.

                <p style = "color: white;">The earliest implementation of TCP/IP dates back to the ARPANET where a packet switching protocol developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn set the stage for communication between networks. Before TCP/IP, only a few thousand bits could be carried per second. The protocol allows for billions of bits to be transferred between devices reliably. Using IP addresses, devices can be readily identified with little to no errors, no matter the nature of the device. <br> <br> This protocol suite provides a set of rules by which data should be containerized and transmitted to avoid as much loss as possible. To test this protocol, in 1975, a two-network test was performed between Stanford University and University College London. They utilized a router which is an intermediary computer that forwards data packets from network to network while managing the immense traffic. <br> <br>TCP/IP rose to popularity in the 1980s when IBM, AT&T and DEC adopted the protocol. In addition, UC Berkeley in 1989 decided to release TCP/IP to the public domain where it was quickly merged by large corporations such as Microsoft and IBP in their commercial software releases. Windows 95 included TCP/IP in its stack. <br> <br> Technical standards that govern the TCP/IP protocol are designated to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). </p></div>

        <p style = "color: white;"> In 1983, Paul Mockapetris was tasked with the mission to create a more user-friendly name for IP addresses, so that people would not have to keep track of the IP addresses of every device. Prior to DNS, a centralized database held mapping information for all the sites on the internet. This practice proved to be unscalable and there was a clear need for DNS. <br> <br> DNS started off as a disconnected protocol where servers did not communicate with each other once there was a change to be made. With the advent of the "NOTIFY" mechanism, ths was fixed and now a server was able to dynamically update other servers it communicates with that a change was made. The master node could now communicate with slave nodes whenever the administrator rolled out an update. To cope with the easily hackable nature of DNS at the time, a layer of security called "DNSSEC" was introduced to prevent users from being redirected to phishing and malicious websites unknowingly. <br> <br> DNS is a technology that is completely scalable and was created to account for the ever-increasing usage of the internet by today's population. The hierarchical nature of DNS however, can sometimes lead to problems since all the reliability falls upon the master node. If the master node experiences interruptions, then all the dependencies will fail and users will be "locked out" of the internet. <br> <br> The future of DNS comes with the development of IPv6, which is a technology that allows for additional digits to be added, hence expanding the capabilities of unique addressing for the growing volume of devices on the internet.</p></div>
