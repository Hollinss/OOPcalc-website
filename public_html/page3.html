            <div class="insidediv2"> <h2 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: white;"> Steve Wozniak </h2>
                <p style = "color: white;">Steve Wozniak is the cofounder of the Apple Computer and is the designer of the first commercially successful personal computer. While Steve is a genius in every sense of the word, his beginnings were quite humble. His first invention was the "Blue Box," a device used to hack into telephone networks to circumvent the long-distance calls charges. This humble device graduated into a microcomputer in 1976, when Wozniak built his own computer with one of the world's first microprocessor, the Intel 8080.<br> <br> This is when he met Steve Jobs, who showed the utmost enthusiasm for Wozniak's inventions. When this computer was not received well by Hewlett Packard, Jobs and Wozniak branched out to start their own company: Apple Computers. With a little revenue from Wozniak's programmable computer and Job's car, they started production from a garage.  <br> <br> From this garage, was the birth of the modern personal computer. A device that would bring the internet to the masses. The Apple 2 was the first computer with a built-in keyboard and color-monitor support. At the time, these features were revolutionary in the computer field. <br> <br> Wozniak's innovation was just taking off, when he faced a tragic accident while piloting his personal aircraft, giving him temporary amnesia. Wozniak however, bounced back twice as strong and went on to manage numerous other ventures such as CL 9, the company responsible for the first programmable universal remote control</p></div>

                <p style = "color: white;">William Henry Gates III is the cofounder of one of the biggest companies in recent history, Microsoft. Similar to Wozniak, he too had humble beginnings. In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed the BASIC interpreter to show MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems). Through this invention, Bill and Allen were able to start their partnership, dubbed "Micro-Soft". Micro for microprocessor and Soft for software. <br> <br> When this software was leaked to computer hobbyists, Bill felt as though he was being cheated out of a payment. He and Allen then branched out to form their own company independent of the MITS, where they delved deeper into the world of developing programming languages. <br> <br> In 1985, after making a deal with IBM, Microsoft launched their first version of Windows. This deal proved to be strained after a few years due to fundamental creative differences. And in 1995, Microsoft independently launched Windows 95.<br> <br> Then, in 2001, Bill decided to enter the gaming market with the launch of the X-box, furthering the advancement of the internet. </p></div>

    <div class="insidediv2"> <h2 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: white;"> Marc Andreessen </h2>
        <p style = "color: white;"> Marc Andreessen is the founder of Mosaic, a user-friendly browser application with integrated graphics which is targeted towards non-technically minded users. Unlike the other pioneers discussed above, Marc fully completed his education in Computer Science. After his education, he worked for a small company that made security products and in 1994, he joined forces with James Clark to launch Mozilla (launched as Netscape Navigator) which automatically became the most popular web browser used within the span of 2 years.<br> <br> The main goal of Netscape was to enable everyday users to access the internet seamlessly and exchange information without having to overcome a significant learning curve. Then, Marc was recruited as the CTO of America Online, Inc. (AOL) which purchased his Netscape technology. His knowledge of how to bring the World Wide Web to the masses by making media such as video and audio and other graphics more accessible, proved to be vital for AOL's success.<br> <br> Mosaic was estimated to increase web usage by over 10,000 % within the two years it was released. With such success, comes fierce competition. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 1.0 released in 1995 quelled the fiery success of Netscape and brought its market down to 60%. To regain popularity, Marc decided to make Netscape free, but this was unfortunately not enough to stop Microsoft's dominance. Especially since Windows computers came with Internet Explorer pre-installed. <br> <br> All in all, Marc Andreessen realized the potential of the internet in households and provided a means of using it free of cost and with relative ease. His impact on the World Wide Web is undeniable.</p></div>
