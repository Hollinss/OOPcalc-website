                <p style = "color: white;">The ICANN is a non-profit organization founded in 1998 responsible for maintaining databases related to namespaces and numerical spaces on the internet. The maintenance work for naming conventions such as IPv4 and IPv6 fall upon the responsibilities of the ICANN. In addition, the ICANN also performs administrative tasks such as enabling competition to incentivize innovation, and maintain a broad representation of varying communities across the internet. It is led by 16 executive board members nominated from different backgrounds. <br> <br> The ICANN preceded an organization called the IANA which was founded during the ARPANET era. As the internet grew, there was a need for an organization for maintain DNS services, and the ICANN was born to hold this responsibility. Amongst the list of responsibilities are: Domain Name Supporting, Address Supporting, and Protocol Supporting.<br> <br> ICANN is made of different groups which coordinate different needs of the internet such as: </p>

                <p style = "color: white;">The W3C, invented by the father of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is an international organization which governs web standards of the internet to realize the full potential of the internet. It is led by Jeffrey Jaffe, the CEO and also by a number of technical experts who help coordinate the operations of the consortium.The W3C is structured via a joint agreement between four "hosts": MIT, ERCIM, Keio University and Beihang University.<br> <br> Global liaisons at W3C maintain a diverse culture at the W3C through ensuring global participation by hosting talks all over the world in a variety of different languages. In order to operate at a massive scale, the W3C maintains a defined work process that promotes the development of high quality web content. These processes promote progress, fairness, and responsiveness. <br> <br>To fuel innovation in this sphere, the W3C also has a patent policy in place. This policy is aimed at facilitating the development of W3C recommendations by W3C working groups and promote the widespread implementation of recommendations on a royalty-free basis. It also addresses issues related to patent creation that may arise along the way.  <br> <br> As the WWW grows, the function of the W3C becomes more necessary to accommodate the sheer volume of web based content. </p></div>
