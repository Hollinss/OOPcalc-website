                <p style = "color: white;">J.C.R Licklider, called "Lick" by many of his peers was the man responsible for setting the stage of the internet as we know it today. He began his work at ARPA, where he was tasked with finding a better use for the Q-32 computer other than mathematical calculation by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA in 1962. <br> <br>To accomplish this task, Licklider sought out leading research institutes at universities to join forces and to form the "Intergalactic Computer Group." Lick, as you can see, had a sense of humor. In 1963, he wrote a memo to the members of the group calling for the standardization of computer systems. He wanted each researcher to be able to build upon each other's work. <br> <br> This memo opened the door for an interconnected network of computers, but was never fully realized by Lick himself. In a few years, however, Larry Roberts, would pick up where Lick left off and architect the ARPANET, The true birthplace of the internet. <br> <br> Licklider's mark on modern computing did not end there. In 1965, he wrote a book that described a theoretical network which holds the capability of storing information electronically, he called it a "procognitive system" which was later on fully realized by Tim Berners-Lee as the World Wide Web.</p></div>

                <p style = "color: white;">Hired as a temporary contractor at CERN in 1980, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a program called "Enquire" for his personal use, to help him remember connections between people and projects. This tool is still used among researchers today to connect their work. Later, in 1989, Tim sought to scale up his Enrique program to develop a system that would create a web of information.<br> <br> He submitted a proposal to CERN which went unnoticed, but despite the setback, he began working on his big idea: HTTTP. The protocol that computers would use as a trademarked method of communicating between each other. In addition, he wrote a client program called "WorldWideWeb" to retrieve and view HTTP documents. <br> <br> However, even after designing HTTP, CERN was unwilling to take on Tim's idea. So, he turned his attention over to the Internet community. In 1991, he made his WorldWideWeb available on the internet, along with his web server software. Upon its release, computer users all over the world began setting up their own web servers, and began linking their websites from his original site "info.cern.ch." The internet was growing <br> <br> Tim's web browser came as an extremely useful tool for scientists all over the world as they could now share their work with much less requests for the same data.</p></div>

        <p style = "color: white;">Robert E. Kahn and Vinton G. Cerf spearheaded the implementation of Transmission Control and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Two primary principals in the functioning of the internet today. After Licklider's "Intergalactic" network idea, it was up to Bob and Vint to carry out the architecture of the communication on the internet. <br> <br> In 1969, Bob and Vint met in UCLA and began tackling the networking problem of the ARPANET. Their idea was to merge two existing ARPA technologies, PRNET and SATNET to create a protocol that would form the internet. However, these two technologies proved to be incompatible and needed major modifications to improve reliability and longevity of network data transfer. <br> <br> The duo then wrote a paper in 1974 called "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication." which outlined the beginnings of TCP/IP. The idea was that a host protocol (TCP) would provide flow-controlled packet transmission over a set of interlinked networks. Then, gateways or routers would aid in the transmission control by directing packets to their destinations while effectively handling the large number of requests coming in from hosts. <br> <br> Using such methods, packets of information could now be handled efficiently and could be realized at much larger scales. Cerf and Kahn led the implementation of their idea in TCP in 1977 and are still involved in the internet community today.</p></div>
