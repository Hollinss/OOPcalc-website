        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> Overview of Design Patterns </h1>
        <p> To write readable and scalable code, we need to adhere to specific design patterns when writing code. In this calculator program, we employ several design pattern principles. The use of patters speeds up the development process by providing efficient code which assess problems before they even occur. Moreover, these patterns allow developers from different teams to communicate effectively as they share the same protocols.<br> <br> Creational design patters are effective since they help delegate tasks to specific classes which perform one operation each. Class-Creation patterns use inheritance effectively (similar to our calculator implementation) and Object-Creation patters are centered around delegation of objects for different tasks.
        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;">  The Factory Method  </h1>
        <img class="licklider" src="factory.jpg" alt="Factory Floor" style="margin-left: 0px;">
        <p> This is a creational design pattern which enables users to create a family structure of objects which share similar properties. Think of a chocolate factory. In a chocolate factory, several products such as biscuits, chocolate bars, wafers, etc. can all be produced. In a way, they all inherit from the chocolate factory class because they all share the same base ingredient, Chocolate. In our calculator, the <code>Calculation</code> class contains our concrete factory method </p>

        <p>Here, from lines 8-11, we define our factory method which creates a Calculation object each time it is called by our Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division classes. The class method variable is set to the tuple of values that are passed into the factory method.</p>
        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> The Facade </h1>
        <img class="licklider" src="facade.jpg" alt="Castle Front" style="margin-left: 0px; height: 400px; width: auto;">
        <p>This pattern provides an interface to interact with complex sets of classes within your program. It enables users to access the inner workings of your program while hiding the complexity of the program. Sounds familiar? (Hint: <i>It's Abstraction</i>).<br>
        <p>For our calculator, we create a python file called <code>calculator.py</code> which handles all of the complex operations such as initialization, keeping track of dependencies, method execution etc. Think of this class as the buttons on a calculator which we can access without being concerned about the inner workings of that same calculator. This practice is especially useful when we want to expand our program to perform more functions. In sort, the facade class connects the user to the calculator program with minimal interaction.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/b2bda4e91528b3f6b5a003a5ce3056a7.js"></script>
        <p>Here, we import the Calculations class which is an additional facade class which performs the calculations AND adds them to the histoy array. Let's analyze the add_numbers static method. This method takes in arguments from the user, a list of numbers and puts them into an immutable datatype called a tuple. Then, it calls the <code>addition_calculation</code> method from within the Calculations class to perform the necessary addition. Then, once the addition is successfully performed, per this method:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/97555ea53429409b16675e5ea796bd83.js"></script>
        <p>the method outputs <code>True</code>.</p>
