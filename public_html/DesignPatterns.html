        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> Overview of Unit Testing </h1>
        <p> Unit Testing is an essential part of software development. I can be either manual or automatic, and provides developers a mechanism by which they can test individual components of their program effectively before moving towards software production. Because of its modular nature, it is important to write tests which test only one particular part of the code. This way, developers can hone in on a certain part of the code without spending time searching for the faulty line. If code is written with OOP Principles governing it, writing easy to read unit tests proves to be a much easier feat. In addition, proper unit testing provides a level of documentation that is necessary and easy to follow by any technical person behind building the program. In addition, unit testing offers early detection privileges and saves costs since it is easier to fix bugs earlier in the agile process than later on. In python, there is a package called <code>pytest</code> that makes writing unit tests much easier and functional. In this article, we will go through various unit tests written using pytest to test every major operation of the calculator. We will use a technique of unit testing called <b>AAA Testing</b> or <b>Arrange-Act-Assert Testing</b> which is a framework that produces easier to follow pytests.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Creating Fixtures  </h3>
        <p> Fixtures are repeatable baseline functions which can be run reliably by every test within a unit testing file. In our case, before each one of our tests, we need to clear the existing history of the calculator: </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/fba3a563f617081a88064376ba940604.js"></script>
        <p>Here, a pytest fixture called <code>clear_history_fixture</code> is created to be repeatedly called each time we need to clear our history array described earlier in the OOP Article. The calculations class is called which contains the history array and the <code>.clear_history()</code> method is accessed to perform this operation.</p>
        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> AAA in Action </h1>
        <p> In the next few subsections, we will cover the Arrange, Act, and Assert pattern. <b>Arrange</b> sets up the framework of the test case. <b>Act</b> performs an action on the the arranged framework. Then <b>Assert</b> using the <code>assert</code> keyword in python to specify the expected output from the section of the program.<br>
        <p>In the below example, we <b>Assert</b> in line 3 by specifying the values we would like to pass into the calculator program. Then in line 4, we <b>Act</b> upon the inputted values by calling the facade calculator program's <code>add_number</code> method. Then in line 5, we <b>Assert</b> the expected output from the <code>Calculations</code> class. In addition, the fixture is called in line 1 within the parentheses. </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/443d82eaec564b5413330886216e9ffe.js"></script>
        <p>The <code>get_result</code> method exhibits polymorphism since the user calls the same calculations class which outputs different results based on which specific calculations the user calls.</p>
        <p>The same pytest is replicated to test the functionality of the other operations of the calculator shown below: </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/8c4821a6e1d91608321137ce0316324b.js"></script>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px;"> Expanding our Tests </h3>
        <p> There is a huge limitation in our tests, more specifically, the division pytest. We have not tested for division by zero! We don't know what our calculator will do when a division by zero occurs. In the below code gist, the pytest uses AAA to test precisely for division by zero. <br>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/77b1208795b4e3ce8ba9a2d6a5517c2f.js"></script>
        <p>Here, we call the <code>raises</code> functionality included in the pytest package to assert the <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> error also included in the pytest package.</p>

        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> Loading External Files to Test Functionality </h1>
        <p> Similar to the multiplication class, this class loops through the tuple and divides each value. In addition, when a division by zero occurs, the program will throw an exception error which is picked up by the pytests we will go through in the next section.<br>
