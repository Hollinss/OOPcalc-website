        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px;"> Object Oriented Programming </h3>
        <p>Also referred to as "OOP", this style of programming allows for developers to think of programs as "objects" as they appear in the real world. This enables an interaction between different created objects in a natural and flexible manner. Interaction between objects is seamless and debugging is made easier due to this style of design.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Class </h3>
        <p> A Class details the specifications/properties of an object in OOP. For instance, if we were to create and "class" of a cup in the real world, it may hold the properties of height, width, material etc.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Object </h3>
        <p> This is an instance of the created class at runtime<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Constructor </h3>
        <p> A Constructor is an element within a class that creates an instance of the created object wherever necessary. If a developer wants to use an object within another file.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Property </h3>
        <p> A property within a class is an element which defines the data within the class. For instance, in JavaScript, if there were a class labeled "cup" and had properties "length, weight and material" it would look like this: </p>
        <div style = "margin: 20px"> <code> class Cup { <br>
            constructor( <br>
            length,
            width,
            material <br>
            ) { <br>
            this.length = 5;
            this.width = 3;
            this.material = "porcelain"; <br>
            } } <br>
        </code> </div>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Interface </h3>
        <p> An interface is a type which contains no implementation. It contains its own set of properties and methods which can be called upon by any class.  </p>
    </div>

        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px;"> Superclass </h3>
        <p> A superclass practices an OOP concept called "Inheritance" where classes are created in a hierarchy. A superclass implements the inheritance concept. A class that contains all the main constructor, and properties that can be "inherited" by it's subclasses.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Subclass </h3>
        <p> A Subclass can utilize properties listed and designed within the superclass. The subclass can modify the methods designed within the superclass, extending the functionality of the OOP object. There can be several subclasses which inherit from one superclass.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Factory Method </h3>
        <p> This is a type of method that creates a new instance of the class without the need to explicitly call the object for initialization. This method is typically localized within the Superclass. This design pattern tremendously eases the debugging of code related problems.<br>
