        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px;"> Object Oriented Programming </h3>
        <p>Also referred to as "OOP", this style of programming allows for developers to think of programs as "objects" as they appear in the real world. This enables an interaction between different created objects in a natural and flexible manner. Interaction between objects is seamless and debugging is made easier due to this style of design.
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Class </h3>
        <p> A Class details the specifications/properties of an object in OOP. For instance, if we were to create and "class" of a cup in the real world, it may hold the properties of height, width, material etc.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Object </h3>
        <p> This is an instance of the created class at runtime<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Constructor </h3>
        <p> A Constructor is an element within a class that creates an instance of the created object wherever necessary. If a developer wants to use an object within another file.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Property </h3>
        <p> A property within a class is an element which defines the data within the class. For instance, in JavaScript, if there were a class labeled "cup" and had properties "length, weight and material" it would look like this: </p>
        <div style = "margin: 20px"> <code> class Cup { <br>
            constructor( <br>
            length,
            width,
            material <br>
            ) { <br>
            this.length = 5;
            this.width = 3;
            this.material = "porcelain"; <br>
            } } <br>
        </code> </div>
