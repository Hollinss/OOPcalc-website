        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> Overview of Unit Testing </h1>
        <p> Unit Testing is an essential part of software development. I can be either manual or automatic, and provides developers a mechanism by which they can test individual components of their program effectively before moving towards software production. Because of its modular nature, it is important to write tests which test only one particular part of the code. This way, developers can hone in on a certain part of the code without spending time searching for the faulty line. If code is written with OOP Principles governing it, writing easy to read unit tests proves to be a much easier feat. In addition, proper unit testing provides a level of documentation that is necessary and easy to follow by any technical person behind building the program. In addition, unit testing offers early detection privileges and saves costs since it is easier to fix bugs earlier in the agile process than later on. In python, there is a package called <code>pytest</code> that makes writing unit tests much easier and functional. In this article, we will go through various unit tests written using pytest to test every major operation of the calculator. We will use a technique of unit testing called <b>AAA Testing</b> or <b>Arrange-Act-Assert Testing</b> which is a framework that produces easier to follow pytests.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Creating Fixtures  </h3>
        <p> Fixtures are repeatable baseline functions which can be run reliably by every test within a unit testing file. In our case, before each one of our tests, we need to clear the existing history of the calculator: </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/fba3a563f617081a88064376ba940604.js"></script>
        <p>Here, a pytest fixture called <code>clear_history_fixture</code> is created to be repeatedly called each time we need to clear our history array described earlier in the OOP Article. The calculations class is called which contains the history array and the <code>.clear_history()</code> method is accessed to perform this operation.</p>
        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> AAA in Action </h1>
        <p> In the next few subsections, we will cover the Arrange, Act, and Assert pattern. <b>Arrange</b> sets up the framework of the test case. <b>Act</b> performs an action on the the arranged framework. Then <b>Assert</b> using the <code>assert</code> keyword in python to specify the expected output from the section of the program.<br>
            <p>In the below example, we <b>Assert</b> in line 3 by specifying the values we would like to pass into the calculator program. Then in line 4, we <b>Act</b> upon the inputted values by calling the facade calculator program's <code>add_number</code> method. Then in line 5, we <b>Assert</b> the expected output from the <code>Calculations</code> class. In addition, the fixture is called in line 1 within the parentheses. </p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/443d82eaec564b5413330886216e9ffe.js"></script>
        <p>The <code>get_result</code> method exhibits polymorphism since the user calls the same calculations class which outputs different results based on which specific calculations the user calls.</p>
        <p>The same pytest is replicated to test the functionality of the other operations of the calculator shown below: </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/8c4821a6e1d91608321137ce0316324b.js"></script>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px;"> Expanding our Tests </h3>
        <p> There is a huge limitation in our tests, more specifically, the division pytest. We have not tested for division by zero! We don't know what our calculator will do when a division by zero occurs. In the below code gist, the pytest uses AAA to test precisely for division by zero. <br>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/77b1208795b4e3ce8ba9a2d6a5517c2f.js"></script>
        <p>Here, we call the <code>raises</code> functionality included in the pytest package to assert the <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> error also included in the pytest package.</p>

        <h1 style = "margin-top: 0px; color: olivedrab;"> Loading External Files to Test Functionality </h1>
        <p> The next step in scaling up our pytests is being able to load external files into our pytest framework. In order to do so, the file type of choice will be a csv (Comma Seperated Values) which is a file type where data is seperated by a comma delimiter. The Pandas library will be used to parse through csv files for this calculator program.<br>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Python Pandas </h3>
        <p>Pandas makes file input manipulation easier by an object called <b>DataFrame</b>. We will load our data into this object and navigate to the necessary fragments. In addition, pandas offers intelligent data handling of missing data and flexible reshaping. <br> <br>As a prerequisite, you must create a file for each calculator operation with 3 columns. The first one holds "value_1", the second holds "value_2" and the last column holds the "result" of the calculation after it is passed into our calculator.</p>
        <h3 style = "margin-top: 0px; "> Loading into a Dataframe </h3>
        <p>Navigate to your additions test file, and ensure that your test function starts with the <code>test</code> keyword so that pycharm recognizes the fact that you are writing a test. Next, we will define a dataframe variable labelled <code>file</code> which performs the <code>read_csv</code> functionality from a relative path specified by us.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/3e69dd154e025b9b6f62328993b9c0f5.js"></script>
        <p>Next, we will iterate through the csv using a pandas tool called <code>iterrows</code> and pass into our calculator a tuple of values by each row.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Hollinss/48ee34c0371cf6ee4b63d539d45f3786.js"></script>
        <p>Here, we specify which row's values we want to pass as values into our program in line 3 <code>row['value_1'], row['value_2']</code> and we <b>Act</b> upon these values in lines 5-7.</p>
